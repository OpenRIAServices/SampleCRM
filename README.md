## Credits 
This app is a fork of [OpenSilver SampleCRM app](://github.com/OpenSilver/SampleCRM) which has been updated to *1. work out of the box*  and *2. use latest version of OpenRiaServices with AspNetCore and EFCore*
This app was inspired by the **InventorySample** app: https://github.com/microsoft/InventorySample (Note: the implementation is very different because it uses RIA Services)
